# Values

Values shape the culture of the company and we believe that the cultural fit
carries as much weight as do skill sets. We look to hire the best talent who
align with our values. We strive to live by these values in our day-to-day work,
no matter the circumstance.

## Client First

We start with our client’s goals in mind, invest in user research and then
work backwards. Our client’s success is our success.

## Take ownership and deliver results

We take ownership to solve problems and deliver results. We own the results of
our actions and take responsibility for our failures. We make sure mistakes are not repeated.

## Action

We take decisions quickly and act upon them. We promote action oriented
behaviour while also valuing discussion based work. We believe that fair judgement
is possible only after trying something out and hence promote a bias to action. 

## Strive for excellence

We ensure that whatever we do, we aspire to become the best in that domain. We
push each other for excellence. We don’t stop until we get there.

## Feedback

We believe that actionable feedback helps each of us grow in our roles. We work
in a culture which encourages continuous flux of feedback from and to peers.

## Disagree and Commit

We believe conflict, discussion and debate are healthy. Ideas win and not the
loudest person in the room or the highest title. We commit to the decisions made
regardless of whether we agree or not.
